# Syrus_DigiFort

Our website will work as an assitant for the patients who have undergone surgery in recent times. We provide suggestions for post surgery care in through various medicines in ayurveda, homeopathy, allopathy and home remedies. Along with this, suggestions for care to be taken for any chances of infection will also be provided after proper analysis of the data provided by the patient and the probability of getting infected through Machine Learning algorithm.
Our system will also provide option for emergency contacts, consultation and availability of attendant nurses who can take care of the patient at his/her residance. A store will also be provided to buy or rent second hand or new medical accessories like wheelchair, etc and display the nearby medical stores for convenience of the patient.
